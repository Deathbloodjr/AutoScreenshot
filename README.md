 This mod will automatically take screenshots of the results screen based on various conditions you can set in the config file.\
 You can set it to screenshot on new crowns, highscores, all plays, and any conditions based on which crowns to screenshot.\
 Just be aware that setting it to screenshot silver crowns will not automatically screenshot gold or rainbow crowns, you'll have to set both of those options to true.
